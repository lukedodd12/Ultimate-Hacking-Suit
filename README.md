Ultimate Hacking Suite

Ultimate Hacking Suite is a self-contained, portable pentesting framework with 200+ hacking tools across 16 categories, inspired by HackingToolkit. Tools are installed automatically via requirements.txt (Python dependencies) and install_tools.sh (system tools and repositories).

Run Ultimate_hacking_tool.py to access a menu-driven interface for launching tools like Nmap, sqlmap, Metasploit, and more.

EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY: Intended for authorized penetration testing, labs, and cybersecurity learning (e.g., HackTheBox, TryHackMe).

Features:

- 200+ Tools: Includes Nmap, sqlmap, Metasploit, Aircrack-ng, Hydra, Sherlock, XSStrike, plus 120+ custom scripts.
- 16 Categories: Anonymity, Information Gathering, Wireless Attacks, SQL Injection, Phishing, Web Attacks, DDoS, RATs, and more.
- Auto-Installation: Python dependencies via pip, system tools via apt or pkg, and git-cloned repositories for full coverage.
- User-Friendly Menu: Text-based UI simplifies launching tools â€” no manual command typing required.
- Portable: Distributed as a .zip file for easy sharing and setup.
- Platform Support: Optimized for Kali/Parrot Linux. Partial support for Termux (Android) with root for some tools.
