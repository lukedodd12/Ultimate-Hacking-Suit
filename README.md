# Ultimate Hacking Suite

A self-contained, portable suite with **200+ pentesting and hacking tools** across 16 categories, inspired by HackingToolkit. Tools are auto-installed via `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies) and `install_tools.sh` (system tools and repos).  

Run `Ultimate_hacking_tool.py` to access a clean, menu-driven interface for launching tools like **Nmap, sqlmap, Metasploit**, and more.  

> **Designed for educational purposes only.** Ideal for pentesting labs like HackTheBox or TryHackMe.

## Features

- **200+ Tools:** Includes Nmap, sqlmap, Metasploit, Aircrack-ng, Hydra, Sherlock, XSStrike, and 120+ custom scripts from HackingToolkit.
- **16 Categories:** Anonymity, Information Gathering, Wireless Attacks, SQL Injection, Phishing, Web Attacks, DDoS, RATs, and more.
- **Auto-Installation:** Python dependencies via `pip`, system tools via `apt` or `pkg`, and git-cloned repos for full coverage.
- **User-Friendly Menu:** Nested text-based UI in `Ultimate_hacking_tool.py` simplifies tool usageâ€”no manual command typing.
- **Portable:** Distributed as a `.zip` file for easy sharing and setup.
- **Platform Support:** Optimized for **Kali/Parrot Linux**. Partial support for **Termux (Android)** with root for some tools.

## Installation

### 1. Unzip the Archive
```bash
unzip ultimate-hacking-suite.zip
cd ultimate-hacking-suite

2. Install Python Dependencies

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

3. Install System Tools and Clone Repos

chmod +x install_tools.sh
sudo ./install_tools.sh

4. Run the Suite

sudo python3 Ultimate_hacking_tool.py

> Requires root for most tools. In Termux, run without sudo if not rooted (some tools may fail).




---

Termux Notes

Use pkg install instead of apt in install_tools.sh.

Tools like Wireshark, Autopsy, or Ghidra may not work without root or a Linux VM.

Install prerequisites:


pkg install git python wget curl clang

Non-Linux Users

Use a Kali/Parrot VM or WSL2 on Windows.

Some GUI tools (Burp Suite, Maltego) require a desktop environment.



---

Usage

sudo python3 Ultimate_hacking_tool.py

or in Termux:

python3 Ultimate_hacking_tool.py

Navigate the menu, select a category, choose a tool, and launch with default/example commands.

Customize commands by editing Ultimate_hacking_tool.py.

Replace placeholders like target.com, your.ip, <BSSID> with real values.

Check tools/other_scripts for additional HackingToolkit scripts.
